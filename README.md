# My-Development-Portfolio
A General Overview of Myself and my Applications 

*User Story*
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

*Acceptance Criteria*
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

*My Application*
This project represents my achievements in coding and general information about me.
<br>A picture of myself is presented at the top of the page, but below a navigation bar for my user.
<br>The page then proceeds to the 'About Me' section, giving a brief self-description.
<br>After, a catalogue of my applications (some still to come!)
<br>The page ends with a "Contact Me" section, which details ways to get in touch with me through various means.
