# My-Development-Portfolio
My development portfolio of deployed work 

This project represents my achievements in coding and general information about me.
A picture of myself is presented at the top of the page, but below a navigation bar for my user.
The page then proceeds to the 'About Me' section, giving a brief self-description.
After, a catalogue of my applications (some still to come!)
The page ends with a "Contact Me" section, which details ways to get in touch with me through various means.
