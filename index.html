                    Good day! My name is Anthony Walker and I am an aspiring web developer! I'm 26 years old and located in Livonia, Michigan.
                    <br> While having taken some college courses, I struggled to find a career path that was suitable for me. From education courses, to engineering, to accounting; nothing seemed to stick.
                    <br> However, over the past couple of years (Thanks Covid!), I've had plenty of time to reevalute my interests and passions during lockdowns. I've come to truly be passionate about coding and creating awesome applications!
